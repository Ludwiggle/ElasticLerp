# ElasticLerp

This WL script reads a MIDI file containing *k* events and it creates an *elastic path* between *k* points in an N-Dimensional space. This high dimensional space could be the latent space of a generative neural network (e.g. GAN).
A standard linear interpolation between two latent vectors has the form
$\sin$
